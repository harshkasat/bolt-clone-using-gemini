# Bolt Clone using Gemini

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A clone of the Bolt application built using Gemini (likely referring to a framework or library not explicitly defined in the provided code snippets).  This project aims to replicate Bolt's core functionality, such as code editing, file management, and a collaborative environment, within a web application.

## Project Overview

This project recreates a simplified version of the Bolt application, focusing on core features like a code editor, file explorer, and potentially a terminal emulator. The goal is to provide a similar user experience to Bolt, but utilizing a different technology stack (likely Gemini).  The application uses React for the frontend and leverages Tailwind CSS for styling. Authentication is handled by Clerk.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (or yarn)
* A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/harshkasat/bolt-clone-using-gemini.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd bolt-clone-using-gemini`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
4. Obtain a Clerk Publishable Key and set it as an environment variable named `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.  This is crucial for authentication.  (See the `main.tsx` file for details.)

## Usage

After installation, start the development server: `npm start` (or `yarn start`). This will open the application in your browser.  The application likely consists of a home page (`Home.tsx`) and a builder page (`Builder.tsx`) accessible after authentication via Clerk.  The `ProtectedRoute.tsx` component handles authentication checks.

Example code snippet from `App.tsx` showing routing:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route element={<ProtectedRoute />}>
          <Route path="/builder" element={<Builder />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

## Project Architecture

The frontend is built using React, leveraging components for code editing (`CodeEditor.tsx`), file exploration (`FileExplorer.tsx`), file viewing (`FileViewer.tsx`), and other UI elements.  Tailwind CSS handles styling.  The backend is not fully described in the provided code but likely uses a separate service (not included in this repository).  Clerk handles user authentication.
